// Pencil rest — a block with a cradle down its top, to park a
// pencil on the desk instead of letting it roll off
//
// A rectangular block with every edge chamfered and one
// cylindrical trough running the length of its top face. The
// pencil lies in the trough. Length is how much of the pencil
// is carried, width is how much desk the block stands on, and
// both are free choices.
//
// THE CRADLE IS NOT A CHOICE. Its radius is the pencil plus a
// clearance, it is cut to exactly half a cylinder, and the
// block is then made as tall as that cut plus the floor left
// under it. Height falls out of the cradle rather than the
// cradle being fitted into a height, which is what makes it
// impossible for the trough to reach the bottom: floor_meat is
// what is left under the deepest point, always, whatever
// pencil the block is cut for and however wide or long it is
// made.
//
// Cutting exactly half the cylinder is the other thing that is
// fixed by construction. The depth of the cut and the radius
// of the cut are one expression, so the trough walls arrive at
// the top face vertical. A deeper cut would undercut the
// pencil — it could not be dropped in, only threaded in from
// the end, and the roof of the undercut would be an overhang.
// Half is the deepest a cradle can be and still open upward,
// and it also leaves the pencil standing half proud, which is
// what makes it easy to pick up.
//
// The trough runs out through both ends. A blind dish would
// need end walls, and end walls in a scoop this shallow are
// the one place a support would be wanted.
//
// A notch across the middle is what makes the pencil possible
// to pick up. It runs clear out through both sides, so a
// finger and thumb come in from the sides and close on the
// pencil's whole diameter rather than reaching down a hole
// after it. Neither of its limits is a number to get right:
//
// - It cannot go deeper than the trough. Its floor is written
//   as the trough's own deepest point, not as a depth of its
//   own, so the two are one plane and the notch can never be
//   the feature that breaks the bottom.
// - It cannot reach the base. What is left under it is
//   floor_meat — the same floor the trough stands on, and,
//   with the notch open at both sides, also the whole tie
//   between the two halves of the block.
//
// That floor lands exactly level with the underside of the
// pencil, which is not a coincidence to be tuned: a round
// pencil beds at the bottom of a round trough, so its lowest
// point and the trough's are the same point whatever the
// clearance. A finger comes in beside the pencil, level with
// its underside, and closes on all of it.
//
// The notch takes nothing off the bottom face. The block
// stands on the footprint it always did and holds the desk the
// same way; what the notch costs is trough. The cradle carries
// the pencil either side of it rather than along the whole
// length, which is why notch_l is asserted against leaving
// less trough at each end than the pencil is thick.
//
// PRINT NOTES:
// - PLA or PETG, no supports needed. Print as modeled, base
//   down.
// - Nothing bridges. The cradle opens upward, so its whole
//   surface faces up, and so does the notch: flat floor,
//   walls straight up off it, open sky out both sides, and a
//   break at the mouth that flares outward as it rises, so
//   even that faces up. The only downward faces in the part
//   are the chamfers along the base, at 45 deg.
// - Every chamfer here has its run and its rise in the same
//   expression, so no value of any knob can turn one into an
//   overhang.
// - Print it solid, or near it. It is a small block and the
//   only thing it has to do is stay put, which is a question
//   of mass and of the friction of the bottom face. The floor
//   under the notch is the one place the block would break if
//   it were picked up by an end and swung, and solid infill is
//   what makes that a non-question.
// - The bottom face is the one that shows least and the top
//   face is the one a pencil rolls on, so this way up also
//   puts the plate's finish where it does no harm.

// ===== MEASURE THIS ON YOUR ACTUAL PENCIL =====
// An outside-the-solid measurement, so plain calipers reach it. It names the
// caliper it needs by the size printed on the tool: a 6 in caliper stops at
// 150 mm, an 8 in at 200 mm, a 12 in at 300 mm

// Outer diameter of the pencil (mm) — outside jaws on the barrel, 6 in
// caliper. A hexagonal pencil is not round: take it across the corners rather
// than across the flats, and use the largest reading, since the corners are
// what the cradle has to clear. Measure the barrel, not the ferrule
pencil_d = 10;

// ===== DECIDE THESE =====
// The footprint. Neither one can reach the cradle, and neither one can change
// its shape

// Length of the block (mm), along the pencil. How much of the pencil is
// carried; a long one is a tray for several, a short one is a bridge under one

// so how hard it is to knock over. It has to be wider than the cradle plus a
// rim either side, which is asserted below
block_w = 30;

// ===== TUNE THESE =====
pencil_clearance = 0.5; // Added to the cradle radius (mm) — the pencil drops in and lifts out rather than being pressed into a socket
floor_meat = 5; // Material left under the deepest point of the cradle (mm). This is the number that keeps the trough off the bottom, and the block grows taller to hold it
chamfer = 1; // Break on every edge of the block (mm)
cradle_ease = 0.6; // Break along both rims of the cradle (mm) — the edge a pencil is rolled over on its way in
notch_l = 24; // Clear opening of the finger notch along the block (mm). This is the room a finger and thumb get, measured between its walls, and it is paid for out of the trough at each end
notch_ease = 0.6; // Break along both walls of the notch at the top face (mm) — the edge a fingertip drags over

$fn = 120;

// ===== DERIVED =====

// The cradle. Radius from the pencil, depth from the radius: one expression
// for both, so the cut is half a cylinder whatever the pencil measures and the
// walls always reach the top face vertical
cradle_r = pencil_d / 2 + pencil_clearance;

// cradle is not fitted into a height, the height is made to hold the cradle

// to half a cylinder, so it is exactly the cradle's diameter

// has taken from one edge and the cradle's own ease from the other
rim = (block_w - mouth_w) / 2 - chamfer - cradle_ease;

// How far the pencil stands above the top face, resting on the arc. Half of it
// less whatever the clearance lets it settle, and it is what there is to pinch
// hold of from above
pencil_proud = pencil_d / 2 - pencil_clearance;

// Where the cradle's ease meets the arc. Held on the circle rather than guessed
// at, so the chamfer runs into the trough wall instead of leaving a step in it
ease_foot = sqrt(cradle_r * cradle_r - cradle_ease * cradle_ease);

// The notch. Its floor is the trough's deepest point written out again rather
// than a depth of its own, so the two are the same plane and no arithmetic
// stands between the notch and the floor it must not break
notch_floor = block_h - cradle_depth;
notch_depth = block_h - notch_floor;

// What the notch opens in the top face, once its own ease has been taken off
// both walls
notch_mouth = notch_l + 2 * notch_ease;

// Trough left at each end of the block, outside the notch and inside the end
// chamfer. With the middle open, this is what carries the pencil
cradle_run = (block_l - notch_mouth) / 2 - chamfer;
