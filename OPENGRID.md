# openGrid notes

Reference for building openGrid parts in this repository. It exists because
openGrid's dimensions are not published as a table anywhere — they live inside
the models — and because several plausible-looking assumptions about the system
turn out to be wrong. Everything here was either measured off a mesh or stated
by someone who owns the tiles.

This file is about the **system**, not about any one part, so it stays at the
top level rather than in a part's directory. Parts link back to it.

## The system

28 mm grid pitch, chosen to be Gridfinity-compatible. Tiles come in several
thicknesses and the thickness decides what snaps fit:

| Tile | Thickness | Takes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Lite | 4 mm | Lite snaps, 3.4 mm, one face |
| Regular ("Full") | 6.8 mm | A full snap, 6.8 mm, filling the tile |
| Heavy | 13.6 mm | **A full 6.8 mm snap in each face** |
| Hybrid | mixed | Regular over most of its area, thicker at one edge |

**A Heavy tile is twice a regular one, not the same as one.** It is built to be
loaded from both sides, which is why it is described as having two fronts and no
back: each snap presents its ears outward and the two shanks meet in the middle.
A Heavy cell fitted from one side only is still half empty from the other. The
13.6 mm figure comes from the tile itself rather than from any snap library —
snap generators only ever know about snap thicknesses.

Lite snaps are not simply thinner full snaps. The nub heights change too
(2 mm becomes 1.8 mm on the basic nub, 4 mm becomes 2.4 mm on the directional
one), so a lite version of a part is a real port, not a one-line change.

## Front and back on a snap

Every feature a full snap has sits in its first 3.4 mm — the four corner ears at
the face itself, the face nubs just behind them. The remaining 3.4 mm is plain
shank.

The **shank is what goes into the tile**. So:

- **Front** = the wide end, carrying the ears. Stays on the side you pushed from
  and faces you. Measured on the mesh it reaches **15.40 mm** from the axis.
- **Back** = the narrow end of the shank, running away from you toward whatever
  the tile is mounted on. Reaches **14.53 mm**.

These are properties of the snap, not of the tile or the wall, so they do not
swap meaning depending on who is holding it. Name variants with them.

## Full snap profile

Reproduced from [mitufy's parametric snap
generator](https://github.com/mitufy/opengrid-projects), which is a recreation
of David D's official snaps. These are the symmetric full-snap numbers, all in
mm, with the front face as the datum:

| Feature | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Thickness | 6.8 |
| Body across flats | 24.8 |
| Corner chamfer leg | `2.7 * sqrt(2) + 1` = 4.81838 |
| Octagon vertices | (±12.4, ±7.5816) |
| Chamfer face radius | 14.1291 |
| Ear height / reach / tip height | 1.5 / 1.1 / 0.4 |
| Ear width at chamfer face | `chamfer * sqrt(2)` = 6.8137 |
| Nub height / reach | 2 / 0.4 |
| Nub width, base → tip | 10.8 → 6.8 |
| Nub face angle | 35° from vertical |
| Nub offset from front face | 1.4 |
| Nub tip rounding | r15 arc, tangent to the tip face at ±1.9147 and to the side at (0.1087, ±4.8568) |
| Relief slot | 12.4 long × 0.6 wide, 0.7 wall outboard, stops 0.6 from the front face |
| Face groove | 12.4 long × 0.8 deep × 0.4 tall, 0.8 from the front face |

The ear underside and the ear's side tapers are all 45°: the ear reaches
`ear_reach` outward while rising `ear_height - ear_tip_height`, and those two are
equal. Write them from one expression so the angle cannot drift.

The nub is best built as an intersection of its plan outline with a wedge that
closes the top and bottom in at 35°. That keeps the tip rounding and the face
angle independent, so neither distorts the other.

## Licensing

openGrid is **CC BY 4.0**. The licence page in David D's official download pack
states it, and the badge there is plain BY — no ShareAlike ring — with remix and
commercial use both permitted and the work marked as an Approved Free Cultural
Work meeting the Open Definition, which NonCommercial and NoDerivatives licences
do not qualify for. Do not take the version from a blog summary; the pack is the
authority, and the difference between BY and BY-SA decides whether a derivative
can carry its own licence.

That is the practical reason to prefer openGrid over Multiboard, which uses a
custom non-commercial licence restricting remixes and paid derivatives.

  CC BY 4.0.

**CC BY 4.0 has no ShareAlike term**, so a part built from the profile can be
released under any licence — this repository keeps MIT. What travels regardless
of the outbound licence is attribution (creator, title, source, licence link),
a statement that the work was modified, and the bar on imposing terms that would
restrict a recipient's rights in the upstream material itself. Every part here
that reproduces the profile carries all of that in its header, and
[LICENSE](LICENSE) scopes the exception so a reader of that file alone cannot
mistake the profile for original MIT work.

Attribution is a condition, not a courtesy.

### The ecosystem is mixed-licence

**openGrid being CC BY 4.0 says nothing about the licence of a given openGrid
part.** CC BY has no ShareAlike term, so an implementation of the standard is
free to be more restrictive than the standard, and some are. Check the `LICENSE`
file of anything you intend to derive from, every time — a search result will not
tell you, and the restrictive projects look exactly like the permissive ones.

The one most likely to catch you out here:

- **QuackWorks** by Andy Levesque (BlackjackDuck) —
  [GitHub](https://github.com/AndyLevesque/QuackWorks) — is
  **CC BY-NC-SA 4.0**, confirmed from the `LICENSE` file rather than a summary.
  NonCommercial *and* ShareAlike, which is closer to Multiboard's terms than to
  openGrid's.

That matters twice over. **Underware is a QuackWorks project**, so the cable
channels these magnet snaps were built to work alongside come from a NC-SA
codebase — fine to print and use, but nothing here may be *derived* from it.
ShareAlike would force CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 onto any file that did, incompatible with
this repository's MIT terms and viral into whatever touched it.

And QuackWorks contains `openGrid/opengrid-snap.scad`. Reaching for that as the
reference when rebuilding the snap profile — an entirely reasonable-looking
thing to do — would have made the parts in this repository NC-SA, and by
ShareAlike anything reproducing them too. The chain actually used is the clean
one:

    David D's openGrid (CC BY 4.0)
      → mitufy's recreation (CC BY 4.0, credits BlackjackDuck as inspiration
        rather than source, which is what lets it be CC BY at all)
      → the files here

## Printing openGrid snaps

Three rules, in priority order:

1. **A magnet or fastener bore must open upward.** A 10 mm circular ceiling is a
   real bridge and is not worth accepting.
2. **The relief slots open out of the back face.** Print front-face-down and they
   have no roof at all. This is free whenever nothing on the front face needs to
   open up.
3. **The face groove has a flat roof in the official profile, whichever way up
   you print it.** Replace it with a 45° gable. The gable stays entirely inboard
   of the face plane, so the groove's mouth is unchanged and a tile cannot tell
   the difference; it costs about 2 mm³ per arm root out of a pocket that exists
   to be empty.

When rules 1 and 2 conflict — a bore on the front face — rule 1 wins and the
slots end up with roofs. **Leave those roofs flat.** They span the slot's 0.6 mm
width, not its 12.4 mm length, which is a gap no support material could occupy.
Every way of angling one is taken out of the 0.6 mm of material above the slot,
and that material is the root the arm hinges on: a 45° gable halves it to 0.3 mm,
under a single 0.42 mm perimeter, and a ramp across the slot consumes it outright
and opens a slit to the front face. The snap fit lives in that hinge and a 0.6 mm
bridge does not.

## Verifying a reimplementation

Every `.scad` here is self-contained, so the snap profile has to be rewritten
rather than included. Check the rewrite against the generator rather than by eye:

```sh
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/BelfrySCAD/BOSL2.git libraries/BOSL2
curl -sLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mitufy/opengrid-projects/main/opengrid_parametric_snap.scad
mkdir lib && cd lib && for f in opengrid_base opengrid_snap_lib openconnect_lib opengrid_threads_lib; do
  curl -sLO "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mitufy/opengrid-projects/main/lib/$f.scad"; done

OPENSCADPATH=$PWD/libraries /Applications/OpenSCAD.app/Contents/MacOS/OpenSCAD \
  -o ref.stl --export-format binstl \
  -D 'generate_snap="Bare"' -D 'snap_body_shape="Symmetric"' \
  -D 'thickness_text_mode="None"' -D 'uninstall_notch_width=0' \
  opengrid_parametric_snap.scad
```

Then boolean-difference your part against `ref.stl` both ways and compare
volumes. **Expect agreement to about 0.02%.** The residue is the generator's own
`EPS = 0.005` shiftout, which sinks each feature 0.005 mm into the body to
guarantee a clean union — it shows up as a thin skin over every nub and ear, and
your clean nominal geometry is arguably the more correct of the two.

The generator's individual features can be isolated for study with
`disable_snap_corners`, `disable_snap_nubs`, `disable_snap_cuts` and
`uninstall_notch_width=0`, which is how the numbers in the table above were
recovered.

## Things that looked true and were not

Recorded because each one cost a rebuild, and each is easy to re-derive wrongly.

- **A Heavy tile is not 6.8 mm.** 3.4 + 3.4 happening to equal 6.8 makes a tidy
  story about two Lite snaps meeting in the middle. It is wrong. Heavy is 13.6
  and takes two *full* snaps.
- **The ears do not go into the tile.** The shank does. So the ear face stays on
  the side you inserted from, which reverses any rule about which variant to
  pick for a given mounting.
- **The slot roofs span 0.6 mm, not 12.4 mm.** The slot is 12.4 long and 0.6
  wide; the bridge distance is the width. Getting this backwards makes an
  acceptable feature look unacceptable and vice versa.
- **The official snap is not overhang-clean.** Its face grooves have flat 90°
  roofs whichever way up it prints. Do not assume a published, widely printed
  part passes a 45° check.
- **"openGrid is CC BY, so openGrid parts are CC BY" does not follow.** The
  standard is permissive; individual implementations of it need not be, and CC
  BY lets them be more restrictive. QuackWorks — which is where Underware lives,
  and which ships its own `openGrid/opengrid-snap.scad` — is CC BY-NC-SA 4.0.
  Picking that as the reference profile instead of mitufy's would have made
  everything here NonCommercial and ShareAlike. Open the `LICENSE` file before
  deriving, not after.
- **The licence is in the download pack, not on the web.** opengrid.world
  renders client-side and says nothing about licensing in its HTML; the
  `openGrid-3D` GitHub repos carry no `LICENSE` file and no SPDX metadata; the
  Printables page returns 403 to a plain fetch. The authoritative statement is a
  licence page inside David D's official download pack. Search summaries will
  cheerfully tell you "CC-BY" without a version, and BY versus BY-SA is exactly
  the distinction that decides whether your own work can carry its own licence.
- **`scripts/overhangs.py` calls anything at absolute z ≤ 1e-3 the build plate.**
  A mesh flipped with `rotate([180,0,0])` and not translated back to z = 0 sits
  at negative z, and every downward facet reads as first layer — so the script
  reports a clean part that is not. Always translate a flipped mesh back onto the
  plate before analysing it.
