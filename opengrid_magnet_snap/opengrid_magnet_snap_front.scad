// ============================================================
// openGrid magnet snap, front face — a full-thickness snap
// carrying a disc magnet in a blind bore.
//
// THIS IS THE VARIANT WHOSE MAGNET IS ON THE FRONT FACE: the
// wide end carrying the corner ears, which stays on the side
// you pushed the snap in from and faces you. Its sibling
// opengrid_magnet_snap_back.scad puts the magnet on the narrow
// end instead, where it comes to rest against whatever the tile
// is mounted on.
//
// Use this one when the magnet has to present outward — to
// catch something steel laid onto the tile — rather than to
// hold the tile up. To stick a tile to steel, use the back one.
//
// FRONT AND BACK, ON A SNAP, MEAN THE WIDE END AND THE NARROW
// END. Every feature a full snap has sits in its first 3.4 mm:
// the corner ears at the face itself, the nubs just behind
// them. The remaining 3.4 mm is plain shank. The shank is what
// goes into the tile, so the wide end stays on the side you
// pushed from and faces you — the front — while the narrow end
// runs away from you toward whatever the tile is mounted on —
// the back. Measured on the mesh, the front reaches 15.4 mm
// from the axis at the ears and the shank only 14.53 mm.
//
// A Heavy tile is 13.6 mm, twice a regular one, and is built to
// take a full 6.8 mm snap in each face. That is why it has two
// fronts and no back: both snaps present their ears outward and
// their shanks meet in the middle. Cells fitted from one side
// only are still half empty from the other.
//
// openGrid snaps normally present a connector on their front
// face: threads, an openConnect head, a zip tie bail. This one
// presents a magnet instead. Drop it into any cell of a regular
// 6.8 mm board, or either face of a 13.6 mm Heavy one, and that
// cell becomes a magnetic pad, so the board can hang off any
// steel surface with no fastener and no adhesive.
//
// It exists to hang an openGrid tile under the top plate of a
// steel speaker stand, where the tile carries an Underware
// cable channel. The cells that are not doing cable duty become
// magnets, and the tile holds itself up.
//
// THIS VARIANT'S BORE AND SLOTS WANT OPPOSITE ENDS UP. The bore
// has to open upward, because a 10.2 mm circular ceiling is not
// something to bridge, and here the bore is on the front face.
// So the front face goes up and the back face goes on the
// plate, which is the reverse of the back variant. That inverts
// the relief slots: instead of opening out of the back face
// they now run up from the plate and stop 0.6 mm short of the
// front face, leaving their closed ends as flat roofs.
//
// THOSE FOUR ROOFS ARE LEFT FLAT ON PURPOSE. Each spans the
// slot's 0.6 mm width, not its 12.4 mm length — a gap no
// support material could be placed in and no printer struggles
// to cross. Every way of angling them is taken out of the
// 0.6 mm of material above the slot, and that material is the
// root the arm hinges on. A 45 deg gable halves the root to
// 0.3 mm, under a single 0.42 mm perimeter. A ramp across the
// slot consumes it outright and opens a slit to the front face.
// The snap fit lives in that hinge and a 0.6 mm bridge does
// not, so the hinge wins. scripts/overhangs.py reports these on
// every build, and the report is correct — they are a decision,
// not an oversight.
//
// If either variant would do the job, print the back one. It
// has no flat roof anywhere.
//
// An optional hole runs from the floor of the bore out through
// the back face. It vents the bore, so cyanoacrylate cannot
// hydraulic-lock against the magnet and push it back out while
// it cures; it pushes a magnet out again if one has to come
// apart; and it passes a fastener, so the magnet can be a
// bolted pot magnet rather than a plain disc. Set through_hole
// false when the magnet is going on with an adhesive dot, which
// needs no vent and leaves a tidier face.
//
// Polarity does not matter. These stick to steel, not to each
// other, so a snap fitted the other way round holds exactly as
// well.
//
// THE SNAP PROFILE IS NOT ORIGINAL WORK. It is the openGrid
// standard snap, reproduced here from mitufy's parametric
// generator so that this file can stand alone:
//   https://github.com/mitufy/opengrid-projects  (CC BY 4.0)
// openGrid itself is by David D — https://www.opengrid.world
// The dimensions in the openGrid interface block below are that
// standard. They are not tuning knobs and changing one makes a
// snap that does not fit a board.
//
// ONE THING HERE DEPARTS FROM THE STANDARD, AND IT IS HIDDEN.
// The official snap's relief groove has a flat roof, which is a
// 90 deg ceiling whichever way up the snap is printed. Here that
// roof is a gable instead. The change is entirely inboard of the
// face plane — the groove's mouth is still the standard 0.4 mm
// tall by 0.8 mm deep, so a board cannot tell the difference —
// and it takes about 2 cubic mm out of each arm root, in a
// pocket that exists to be empty.
//
// PRINT NOTES:
// - PETG, PLA or ASA, no supports needed.
// - Print as modeled, back face down and bore facing up. Do not
//   let the slicer turn it over: that puts a 10.2 mm ceiling
//   over the magnet bore, which is a real bridge rather than
//   the 0.6 mm ones this orientation accepts.
// - Worst overhang is 90 deg at the four slot roofs, by choice,
//   over a 0.6 mm span. Behind those it is 45 deg at the groove
//   gable and 35 deg at the nub faces. Still no supports —
//   turning them on would only scar the faces.
// - 4 perimeters, 30% infill or more. The four arms are what
//   the snap fit lives in and they are thin.
// - The whole back face lands on the plate, so first layer
//   adhesion is easier here than on the back variant, where
//   only the four ears touch.
// - Drop the magnet in after printing, bore side up. With the
//   through hole on, wick a little thin CA down it from the ear
//   side rather than puddling glue in the bore. With it off,
//   use an adhesive dot: a blind bore has nowhere to vent, and
//   a slug of CA under a disc will lift it back out.
// - Fit the snap to the board from the working-face side, the
//   same way any openGrid snap goes in. The ears pass the cell
//   and spring out behind it.
