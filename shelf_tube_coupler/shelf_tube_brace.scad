// ============================================================
// Turn-N-Tube shelf brace — diagonal triangulating link
// The third link that makes two adjacent shelf units rigid.
//
// Two couplers at one level do not hold the units still. Each
// is pinned at both ends by a round tube in a round hole, so
// the pair forms a four-bar linkage: one degree of freedom, no
// matter how stiff the couplers are or how far apart they sit.
// The units stay parallel and shear sideways. That is
// kinematic, not a stiffness problem, which is why the
// coupler's old gap-filling wall never fixed it — friction was
// all it had.
//
// Two rigid bodies have three degrees of freedom in plan and
// each link removes one, so three links lock them together.
// This brace is the third. It runs diagonally from one unit's
// FRONT post to the other unit's BACK post, so it is not
// parallel to the couplers and takes away the freedom they
// leave behind.
//
// Three links is the entire requirement. One brace anywhere in
// the stack makes the pair rigid; couplers at the other levels
// only add stiffness.
//
// PRINT NOTES:
// - Modelled as a straight bar. The diagonal is where it goes,
//   not what it is.
// - Long. Turned 45 degrees on the bed it needs far less room
//   than it does square on — check the echoed bed placement.
// - PETG, no supports, flat on the bed. Flat runs the
//   perimeters along the load path; on edge would load the
//   part across its layers.
// - It shares posts with the couplers at whichever level it
//   goes on, resting on one at each end, so it sits level a
//   coupler's height above the shelf.
// - One per pair of units, not one per level.

// ===== MEASURE THESE ON YOUR ACTUAL SHELVES =====
// Outside diameters, edge runs, and clear gaps between solids — every one of
// them is a measurement calipers can physically reach. Each names the caliper
// it needs, by the size printed on the tool: a 6 in caliper stops at 150 mm,
// an 8 in at 200 mm, a 12 in at 300 mm. This one wants a 12 in

// Tube's outer surface out to the facing edge of its own shelf (mm), 6 in
// caliper, measured on the side that faces the other unit. Same measurement the
// coupler uses, and it has to match — the two parts share the across-the-gap
// hole spacing

// stops, and that is the whole reason this parameter is a gap and not a span.
// Inside jaws into the open space between the front and back tube at any shelf
// level, wiggled for the smallest reading — that minimum is the gap along the
// line of centres, which is what this wants. Measured at 200.3 and recorded as

// to derive the diagonal instead

// Deliberately looser than the coupler's fit. The brace is a length-critical
// part with no slot to take up error, and its diagonal is derived from two
// measurements rather than read off the shelves directly, so this buys
// tolerance for both. It costs about half of it in residual sway, which is
// nothing against the free degree of freedom it removes
