A rigid collar that ties two adjacent Turn-N-Tube wire shelf units together at
one tube height, replacing zip ties.

The body is a lozenge that slips over both vertical tube posts, holding them a
fixed distance apart. It rests on the shelf below and carries no other features
— what it does is hold the spacing, and it does not hold the units square. The
brace below is what does that.

The coupler **defines** the spacing rather than fitting it. Nothing depends on
how far apart the units happen to sit today, so there is no need to get calipers
between the tubes at all.

**Measuring.** Two measurements, both reachable from outside:

| Parameter | Measure | Caliper |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `tube_od` | Outside jaws on a vertical tube post | 6 in |
| `tube_to_edge` | A tube's outer surface out to the facing edge of its own shelf | 6 in |

Override `left_tube_to_edge` / `right_tube_to_edge` if the two units differ —
a shelf that overhangs further on one side, or a post not set the same distance
in.

**Deciding.** `shelf_gap` is the gap you want between the two units' facing
shelf edges, and the hole spacing follows from it. A gap is worth having:
adjacent units rarely have their shelves at matching heights, and a deliberate
gap keeps that mismatch from reading as a misalignment.

Earlier versions could hang a wall below the collar to fill that gap. It is
gone. It was sold as resisting twist and it does not — see the brace below for
why no arrangement of couplers can — and covering the gap was never worth a
part that also had to fit into it. Nothing replaces it: the gap stays open, and
small items can drop through.

Spacing can drift between levels if the unit tapers, so measure per shelf and
build a variant per size if they differ.

**Printing.** PETG, no supports. Print collar-axis vertical as modelled so the
holes come out round and the tube slides through. Budget two per shelf level —
eight for a five-tier unit, since the top shelf has no tube above it.

## Shelf tube brace

The third link that makes a coupled pair of units rigid. It shares the coupler's
directory because the two are one system.

Couplers on their own do not hold the units still. Each is pinned at both ends by
a round tube in a round hole, so a pair of them makes a four-bar linkage: one
degree of freedom, whatever their stiffness and however far apart they sit. The
units stay parallel and shear sideways. More couplers do not help, because they
all run the same direction. The freedom is kinematic, which is why the coupler's
old gap-filling wall never closed it — friction was the only tool it had.

Two rigid bodies have three degrees of freedom in plan and each link removes one,
so three links lock them together. The brace is the third: a long flat bar
running diagonally from one unit's **front** post to the other unit's **back**
post, not parallel to the couplers and so removing what they leave behind.

Three links is the entire requirement, so **one brace makes the pair rigid** no
matter how many levels are coupled. Couplers elsewhere in the stack only add
stiffness.

**Measuring.** Three measurements, all within reach of a caliper:

| Parameter | Measure | Caliper |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `tube_od` | Outside jaws on a vertical tube post | 6 in |
| `tube_to_edge` | A tube's outer surface out to the facing edge of its own shelf — must match what the couplers were printed with | 6 in |
| `post_clear_gap` | Inside jaws into the open space between one unit's front and back tube, at any shelf level | 12 in |

`post_clear_gap` is a gap between the posts rather than a span across them
because that is what a caliper can actually reach. The posts are round and the
back one stands against a wall, so there is nothing to hook a tape on, while the
open space between them takes inside jaws. Wiggle for the smallest reading — the
minimum is the gap along the line of centres, and the derivation adds one tube
diameter back on.

It needs a 12 in caliper. At 200.3 mm these shelves are just past where an 8 in
one stops, which is close enough to look measurable and isn't.

It ships as 200, measured off these shelves at 200.3. Measure your own before
printing: the brace has no slot to take up error, and its hole spacing tracks
this number nearly one for one. If the two units differ or do not sit flush at
the front, skip both and set `brace_clear_gap` — the diagonal clear gap measured
straight off the assembled pair, one unit's front tube to the other's back tube,
nearest faces. That one runs longer still, about 212 mm here, so it is a 12 in
caliper too.

`hole_clearance` is deliberately looser here than on the coupler, buying
tolerance for a diagonal that is derived from two measurements rather than read
off the shelves directly, at the cost of about half of it in residual sway.

**Printing.** PETG, no supports, flat on the bed. Flat runs the perimeters along
the load path, where on edge would load the bar across its layers. It is long
enough that placement matters: the echoed bed placement gives the angle and the
square it needs, and turning it 45° costs far less bed than laying it square on.
`bed_size` and the per-edge `bed_margin` drive an assertion, so a gap too big for
the printer fails the render rather than the print. One per pair of units.

The [dogbone](../shelf_tube_dogbone/README.md) does the same job a different
way. Prefer the brace when you want one part and no hardware, and can measure
carefully; prefer the dogbone when you would rather not have the fit depend on a
measurement at all.
