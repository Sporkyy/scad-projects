// ============================================================
// Turn-N-Tube shelf dogbone — two-piece four-hole plate
// Makes a pair of adjacent shelf units rigid in one part,
// printed as two halves that bolt together.
//
// Couplers cannot hold two units square however many are
// fitted. Each is pinned at both ends by a round tube in a
// round hole and they all run the same direction, so the pair
// keeps a degree of freedom to shear front-to-back. Two pins
// into one unit is what removes it: pinned at two posts, a
// rigid plate cannot rotate relative to that unit, and a plate
// gripping two posts on each unit locks the two together.
//
// So this plate takes all four posts at one level — both units,
// front and back. Whole, it is about 286 mm long on the
// measured 200 mm post_clear_gap, past what a 256 mm bed
// takes; the bolted lap at mid-depth is what makes it
// printable here at all, and what keeps it printable on deeper
// units and smaller beds. It is one rigid body once assembled,
// which is all the geometry cares about.
//
// FOUR ROUND HOLES WOULD NOT GO ON. Four holes on four posts
// dictates the front-to-back post spacing of BOTH units at
// once, and two units that disagree by a few mm would leave
// the plate bridging nothing. So the front pair locates and
// the back pair are slots running front-to-back: the round
// holes fix position, the slots take up whatever the two units
// disagree about, and rotation stays fully constrained because
// each slot is elongated along the line to its own round hole.
// Nothing is left loose — every direction that matters is held
// by a hole wall, not by friction.
//
// PRINT NOTES:
// - PETG, no supports. Both halves print flat, lap face down,
//   and the step down to the lap is a drop in height rather
//   than an overhang.
// - The halves are exported side by side as two bodies. Let
//   the slicer arrange them; it is not a plate layout.
// - Assemble with two M4 bolts through the lap. The FRONT half
//   goes on as printed, the BACK half turns over — its lap
//   then sits on top of the front's and the assembly is flat
//   plate_thickness throughout.
// - One dogbone makes a pair of units rigid. It does not have
//   to be repeated per level; couplers elsewhere in the stack
//   only add stiffness.
// - Sits on top of whatever couplers share its posts.
