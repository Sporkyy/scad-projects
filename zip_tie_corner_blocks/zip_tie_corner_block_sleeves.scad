// Zip tie corner block sleeve — a TPU liner that goes between
// one leg of a corner block and the flat it bears on
//
// The block is rigid, and everything it presses against is a
// painted, powder-coated or anodized flat. This sleeve is the
// soft layer in between: it grips, it spreads the tie's load
// over a surface that is never quite flat, and it is the part
// that takes the scuffing instead of the finish underneath.
//
// It is a shallow tray. The floor is the pad, and it is the
// whole working surface — it lies on the block's inner face
// and bears on the object. Three lips stand off it, and they
// cover the three faces next to that one: the block's top, its
// bottom, and the end face at the tip of the leg. The fourth
// edge is not a face at all. It is where the corner relief
// cuts the block away and the other leg's sleeve sits, so
// there is nothing there to wrap.
//
// The lips are not the fastening. Glue is. What they do is
// hold the sleeve still while the glue is wet, and each pair
// does it in a different direction: the side lips square the
// sleeve up across the face, and the end lip is a stop that
// locates it along the leg. Pushed on until it meets the leg
// tip, the sleeve is placed in every direction at once, with
// nothing to line up by eye. TPU is printed a shade narrow
// across the channel and snaps onto the block, and the glue
// cures with everything already where it belongs.
//
// The end lip has to stay clear of the mouth of the block's
// channel, which opens in that same end face. It is asserted
// below, and it is the constraint that decides how far any of
// the lips can reach.
//
// ONE LEG, ONE SLEEVE. A block has two inner faces, so it
// takes two of these, and a set of four blocks takes eight.
// They are all the same part, and it is symmetric top to
// bottom, so there is no handedness and no right way up. There
// is a right way round: the end lip goes to the tip of the
// leg, and the open end to the corner.
//
// The sleeve stands the block off the flats by its own pad
// thickness, which lifts the tie the same amount. Nothing in
// the block minds, and the corner relief only gains clearance,
// but the echoed standoff below is the one the assembled joint
// actually has.
//
// THE PARAMETERS UP TO THE SECOND BLOCK BELOW ARE COPIES.
// They have to hold the same values as the block's, or the
// tray will not fit the block it was cut for. Change one and
// change it in both files.
//
// Modeled in its print orientation: pad flat on the plate,
// lips pointing up.
//
// PRINT NOTES:
// - TPU, no supports needed. Print as modeled, pad down.
// - Nothing in the part hangs, at all. Every face is vertical,
//   on the plate, or facing up — including the two lead-in
//   bevels at the side lips, which taper the tips at 45 deg
//   and so point upward rather than down.
// - Only the side lips are tapered. They are the pair that has
//   to snap over the block; the end lip is slid up to rather
//   than pushed over, so it stays square.
// - Pad down puts the plate's finish on the face that bears on
//   the object and leaves the printed top surface as the glue
//   face, which is the way round that suits both.
// - The block's foot chamfer leaves a groove along one edge
//   between the pad and the block. That is a glue reservoir,
//   not a gap to close.
// - 3 perimeters. At this size the lips are perimeters the
//   whole way through, which is what makes them springy rather
//   than crumbly.
// - Cyanoacrylate or contact cement. TPU takes both; the rigid
//   filament under it is what decides.
// - This source emits ONE sleeve. Print eight for a set of
//   four blocks.
// ============================================================

// ===== MEASURE THESE ON YOUR ACTUAL ZIP TIE =====
// The same two measurements the block is built from, and they set the height
// of the channel here. Each names the caliper it needs by the size printed on
// the tool: a 6 in caliper stops at 150 mm, an 8 in at 200 mm, a 12 in at
// 300 mm

// Width of the tie's strap (mm) — outside jaws across the flat of the strap,
// 6 in caliper. Measure the plain strap well away from the head
tie_width = 3.5;

// Thickness of the tie's strap (mm) — outside jaws on the edge of the strap,
// over the ratchet teeth rather than between them, 6 in caliper
tie_thickness = 1.3;

// ===== THESE MUST MATCH THE BLOCK =====
// Copies of the block's knobs, carried here because the sleeve has to come out
// the same size as the block it wraps. Nothing below is a free choice: read
// each one off the block's source and keep the two files in step

tie_clearance = 0.6; // The block's channel clearance — feeds the block height
deck = 1.6; // The block's top and bottom skins — feeds the block height

outer_wall = 2.4; // The block's outer flange — feeds the leg thickness
foot_chamfer = 0.6; // The block's foot chamfer — the groove it leaves is the glue reservoir

// ===== DECIDE THESE =====
// The sleeve's own shape

// Thickness of the pad (mm). All of the cushion and all of the grip is this
// number, and it is also how far the block is stood off the flat. It has to
// stay under the corner relief radius or the two sleeves on one block meet at
// the corner
pad_thickness = 1.6;

// How far every lip folds over the face behind it (mm). Enough to hold the
// sleeve square and stop it while the glue goes off; it does not have to reach
// far, and the end lip is the one that runs out of room first, since the
// block's channel opens in the face it lies on
lip_reach = 3;

// Thickness of each lip (mm). Thin enough for the side pair to spring over the
// block, thick enough not to tear off it
lip_thickness = 1.2;

// ===== TUNE THESE =====
block_pinch = 0.2; // SUBTRACTED from the block height (mm) — the channel is printed narrow and stretched on, so it holds itself in place before it is glued
lip_lead_in = 0.6; // Taper at the mouth of each side lip (mm) — how far out of square the sleeve can start and still snap on
